	abstract = {Driven by its healthy and nutritious attributes, the US avocado market has experienced tremendous growth over the past two decades. This publication provides a comprehensive overview of US avocado production and trade. The US avocado market, marked by the decline of already limited US domestic production, is increasingly reliant on imports, especially those from Mexico. This overview aims to inform industry stakeholders and policymakers of the current state of the industry and offer insights into its sustainability.},

	abstract = {It has been difficult to infer the genetic history of avocado breeding, owing to the role of hybridization in the origin of contemporary avocado cultivars. To address this difficulty, we used the model-based clustering program, STRUCTURE, and nucleotide polymorphism in 5960 bp of sequence from 4 nuclear loci to examine population structure in 21 wild avocado accessions. The origins of 33 cultivars were inferred relative to the wild sample. Nucleotide sequence diversity in domesticated avocados ranged between 80\% and 90\% of that observed for the same loci in wild avocado, depending on the diversity statistic used for comparison. Substantial genetic differentiation among 3 geographic groups of wild germplasm corresponded to the classically defined horticultural races of avocado. Previously undetected genetic differentiation was revealed in wild populations from Central Mexico, where 2 subpopulations were distinguished based on elevation and latitude.},

	abstract = {The avocado, alligator pear or avocado pear (Persea americana) is an evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated in Mesoamerica more than 5,000 years ago. It was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala. Avocado trees have a native growth range from Mexico to Costa Rica. 
Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator pear or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed. Sequencing of its genome showed that the evolution of avocados was shaped by polyploidy events and that commercial varieties have a hybrid origin. Avocado trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output. Avocados are presently cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries. As of 2023, Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados, supplying 29\% of the global harvest of 10.5 million tonnes.
The fruit of domestic varieties have smooth, buttery, golden-green flesh when ripe. Depending on the cultivar, avocados have green, brown, purplish, or black skin, and may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. For commercial purposes, the fruits are picked while unripe and ripened after harvesting. The nutrient density and high fat content of avocado flesh are advantages for various cuisines, including vegetarian diets.
In major production regions like Chile, Mexico and California, the water demands of avocado farms place strain on local resources. Avocado production is  implicated in other externalities, including deforestation and human rights concerns associated with the partial control of their production in Mexico by organized crime. Global warming is expected to result in significant changes to the suitable growing zones for avocados, and place additional pressures on the locales in which they are produced due to heat waves and drought.},
